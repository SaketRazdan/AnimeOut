        <h3>Chainsaw-Man</h3>
        <p>Chainsaw Man is a much-anticipated anime about a guy who turns into a living chainsaw and hunts devils. As
          awesome and gnarly as it sounds, that's all there is to it, at least for the first episode. Like a lot of
          anime
          openers, this one focuses on world-building and setup.</p>

        <h3>Monster</h3>
        <p>The original idea for Monster came from the 1960s American television series The Fugitive, which had a strong
          impact on Urasawa when he saw it at the age of eight. In the story, a doctor is wrongfully convicted of
          murder,
          but escapes and searches for the real killer while on the run from the police.</p>
